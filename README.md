# Windy-Weather
Weather Application, Location Enabled

Weather Application which gives you the hourly and weekly data for the user's location.
Uses Darksky Weather API.
Implemented Hourly Report using Recycler Views.
Implemented Weekly Report using Custom List Views.
For Location I used a github repository - https://github.com/mrmans0n/smart-location-lib
